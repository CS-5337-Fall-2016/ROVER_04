Meeting venue-Et 245, Time-4pm, Date:12th october,2016

# Issues discussed - A star algo implementation, Communication module , collecting radio-active elements
resolving merge conflict and local errors occuring in eclipse.
# Solved the error about rover as we have modified the movement algo,earlier it used to go vertically or horizontally 
but right now we implemented new method so it started moving in all direction.
#The rover moves in zig-zag direction and aims in the destination co-ordinates(jackpot) 

# Since friday till today PROGRESS REPORT : 1)Arish & vishal-working on communication module
                                            2) Sagar & juhi - working on drill part
